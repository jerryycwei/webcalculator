webcalculator
=============

Designed a web page to host a simplified calculator service.

Hosted at http://cs.mcgill.ca/~jwei8/calculator.html

Takes two text fields and a radio button, for numerical inputs and mathematical operator respectively.

On server-side, used perl script to handle sent form data, perform correct calculations, and send results back to the browser.
